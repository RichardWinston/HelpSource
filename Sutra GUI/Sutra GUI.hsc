\par 
\par \pard\li720\sb120\cf0\i\f2 Note: Some sections of this document, particularly those dealing with two-dimensional models are extracted from Voss and others (1997) and are presented here with only minor modifications. 
\par \pard\fi720\sb240\i0 The numerical model is a modern tool of the hydrologist involved in practical or theoretical evaluation of subsurface flow and transport processes.  Numerical models cannot be considered as exact representations of the real world because the complexity of natural hydrogeologic systems is not easily captured in a discrete model representation.  The strongest application of numerical modeling is to test hypotheses concerning the major hydrogeologic controls on subsurface system behavior.  The most popular use of numerical models is to predict the response of subsurface systems to applied stresses.  Both of these uses often are time consuming because numerical models have complex data requirements, and it is rarely practical for hydrologists to carry out thorough analyses.  Application of numerical models and the modeling process itself can be facilitated by the development and use of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that can manage and synthesize geospatial information and simulation control parameters, create meshes and other formatted input data for the numerical models, and display the simulation results. 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 This report describes a GUI developed for SUTRA, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) finite-element model for saturated-unsaturated, variable-density ground-water flow with solute or energy transport (\cf3\strike Voss and Provost, 2002\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=Voss02\}\cf0 ).  This GUI for SUTRA, \b SutraGUI\b0 , was developed using commercially available software developed by Argus Interware.  The Argus Interware product, known as Argus Open Numerical Environments (Argus ONE\'99), is a model-independent, programmable system with geographic information system (GIS) functionality that includes automated gridding and meshing capabilities for synthesizing geospatial information and linking it with finite-difference and finite-element discretizations.  The programmable nature of Argus ONE allows geospatial information and simulation control parameters to be exported to ASCII files that can be read by a numerical model, which in this case is SUTRA.
\par Attributes of Argus ONE make it particularly flexible for model developers.  Argus ONE allows externally developed Plug-In Extensions (PIEs) (executable codes loaded into the memory of Argus ONE at run time) that appear as an integral part of the Argus ONE user environment.  PIEs may be developed independently by users (Argus Interware, 1997) and are similar in use to user-programmed macros for common spreadsheet and word-processing software.  For example, PIEs can be developed for purposes such as spatial interpolation, grid and mesh generation, geostatistics, and control of model pre- and post-processing.  In addition, Argus ONE allows users to import geospatial information from other GIS-type applications to provide compatibility with existing user projects.  For \b SutraGUI\b0 , the PIE provides, among other utilities, a dialog box for entry of certain input data and a means of using the 2D Argus ONE technology to generate input data for both 2D and 3D SUTRA models.
\par \b SutraGUI \b0 consists of a public domain, freely available PIE that must be used in conjunction with the Argus ONE commercial package.  Together, these codes provide a fully functioning graphical pre- and post-processor for 2D simulation, and a preprocessor for 3D simulation.  Other software provides post-processing for 3D models (\cf3\strike Souza, 1999\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=Souza\}\cf0 ; \cf3\strike Hsieh and Winston, 2002\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=Hsieh\}\cf0 ).  These codes significantly reduce the time and effort required to use SUTRA as a hydrologic tool.  In addition, the advanced user may apply programmable features within Argus ONE to extend or modify SutraGUI to meet the unique demands of any modeling project.  
\par This report is a description of the use of SutraGUI and is not intended as a description of the programming used to develop the PIE.  It is assumed herein that the reader has knowledge of the basic data requirements and underlying principles for using the USGS SUTRA code.  \cf3\strike Voss and Provost (2002)\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=Voss02\}\cf0  provide thorough discussions of the principles underlying SUTRA and its application to hydrologic problems.  Moreover, it is assumed that the reader has knowledge of the general attributes and use of Argus ONE.  Information about Argus ONE can be obtained from the Argus ONE User's Guide (\cf3\strike Argus Interware, 1997\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 ) and the World-Wide Web site for Argus Interware (\cf1\strike\f3\fs20 http://www.argusint.com\cf4\strike0\{link=*! ExecFile("http://www.argusint.com")\}\cf0\f2\fs24 ), from which a demonstration version and documentation may be downloaded.
\par \pard\li720\sb120\i Note: Users should familiarize themselves with the Argus ONE User's Guide (\cf3 Argus Interware, 1997\cf4\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 ) before attempting to use SutraGUI.  In particular, users should be familiar with chapters 2 and 3, pages 91-162.\cf2\i0\f1

\par \pard\fi700\sb120\cf2\f1 In Argus ONE, "Layers" are a series of GIS coverages or maps.  Layers can have "Parameters" that represent the type of data that is specified in the Layer.  Layer names and parameter names are shown in bold.  If part of a layer name is sometimes absent, the part that is sometimes absent is included in parentheses.  If there are two different versions of a layer name, the two different versions are separated by a slash (/) mark.  If a layer name has a number after it to designate a particular unit, the number is included in square brackets.
\par \pard\fi700 An example of a layer including all these options is \b (Top/Bottom) Sources of Solute / Energy (Unit[i])\b0 .  For two-dimensional (2D) models using solute transport, the name of this layer would be \b Sources of Solute\b0 .  In two-dimensional models using energy transport, it would be called \b Sources of Energy\b0 .  In three-dimensional (3D) models, the name of the layer is followed by \b Unit[i]\b0 , where i represents the number of the unit.  For the second unit, i=2, and the name of the unit would be followed by \b Unit2\b0 .  In the uppermost unit, there can be one such layer for the top of the unit and another for the bottom of the unit.  These two layers would be \b Top Sources of Solute Unit1\b0  and \b Bottom Sources of Solute Unit1\b0 , \cf0\f4 respectively.\f2

\par 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\sa240\cf0\f2 This section provides a brief description of how the Argus ONE environment with SutraGUI is used to create and evaluate 2D numerical simulations with SUTRA.  More detail on each step may be found in subsequent sections of this report.
\par \pard\fi-360\li1080\sb120\tx1100 1.\tab After starting Argus ONE, the Argus ONE Window appears and the user begins pre-processing for SUTRA by selecting \b PIEs|New SUTRA Project\b0 .  This causes the \b SUTRA Project Information\b0  dialog box to appear.
\par 2.\tab The user then chooses the desired type of simulation problem, such as areal solute transport, cross- sectional variable-density flow with solute transport, saturated-unsaturated flow with energy transport, or other available types.  This choice determines the kinds of geospatial coverages (information layers) required for such a SUTRA simulation and automatically makes them available to the user for data entry and manipulation.
\par 3.\tab Next, the user may enter simulation control parameters (those that are not spatially-dependent in other words, 'nonspatial information', such as time-step size) in other parts of the \b SUTRA Project Information\b0  dialog box that appears on the computer screen.  Individual panes in the dialog box are selected by selecting the names of the panes on the left side of the dialog box.  Upon completing data entry or editing of these values, the user closes the dialog box and returns to the Argus ONE window. 
\par 4.\tab The user should then modify the default information in any geospatial information layer, by manually drawing closed or open contours, or points to represent the desired spatial distributions of hydrogeologic and hydrologic parameters, sources, sinks, boundary conditions, and a desired distribution of finite-element mesh density.  As an alternative to drawing, any of these spatial distributions may be directly imported from other applications that can generate text files, DXF (AutoCAD\'99 format) files, or Shape (ArcView\'99 format) files.
\par 5.\tab Next, the user creates the finite-element mesh using commands built into Argus ONE or provided by the \b SutraGUI\b0 .  Two mesh types are available, a general irregularly-connected mesh of quadrilaterals (normally provided in Argus ONE), and a "fishnet mesh" of regularly connected quadrilaterals (provided by \b SutraGUI\b0 ).  Before finally proceeding to run SUTRA, the user may modify any of the spatial or nonspatial information that has already been input.
\par 6.\tab The user then selects the \b SUTRA Mesh\b0  layer, and from the menu PIEs, proceeds to export the geospatial and nonspatial information, at which time Argus ONE writes out the standard input- data files for SUTRA to the selected directory and runs the SUTRA simulation.  When the simulation is complete, the user may choose to plot any of the simulation results within Argus ONE in a post-processing step provided by \b SutraGUI\b0  for 2D problems, or the plot is done externally for 3D problems using \b SutraPlot\b0  (\cf3\strike Souza, 1999\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=Souza\}\cf0 ) or \b Model Viewer\b0  (\cf3\strike Hsieh and Winston, 2002\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=Hsieh\}\cf0 ).
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 
\par \pard\fi720 The power of the GUI approach in hydrogeologic hypothesis testing and practical modeling should be apparent to any experienced modeler at this point.  The user can return to any type of spatial information already input to the SUTRA-Argus ONE environment, make major modifications to it or the finite- element mesh, re-export from Argus ONE, run SUTRA, and graphically evaluate results of new simula\-tions.  Each cycle of changing information, running SUTRA, and inspecting results, can take as little as a few minutes depending on the number of model nodes and the speed of the computer.

\par \cf0\b0\fs20 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\f1\fs24 The hydrogeological properties of an area and their distribution in two or three dimensions are represented in Argus ONE as a set of 2D maps.  These are referred to as "\i Information layers\i0 ."  In GIS applications, these are referred to as 'coverages'.  The specific layers created by \b SutraGUI \b0 are described in the section, "Layer Descriptions."  Associated with most layers is a set of one or more parameters.  These parameters represent the data associated with the 2D-space associated with the layer.  Each parameter has an "\i Expression\i0 " associated with it.  \i Expressions \i0 in Argus ONE provide a default (or 'background') value for a parameter that may be based on mathematical operations on data stored elsewhere in the data file.  A layer may contain one or more \i contours \i0 that represent the location of data.  A \i contour \i0 may be a single point (\i point contour\i0 ), a series of connected points (\i open contour\i0 ) or a polygon (\i closed contour\i0 ).  For each contour on a layer, the user may assign a value for each parameter.  The value of a parameter at any specific point will depend on the contours on the layer, the values assigned to the parameters for those contours, the default expression for the parameter, and the \i Interpretation \i0 method for the layer.  Interpretation methods can be \i Nearest\i0 , \i Exact\i0 , or a variety of \i Interpolation \i0 methods as described in the Argus ONE User's Guide (\cf2\strike Argus Interware, Inc., 1997\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 ).
\par As an example, consider the \cf2\b\strike Hydraulic Conductivity\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1530\} \cf0\b0 layer.  In 2D models, it has three parameters: \cf2\b\strike maximum\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1540\}\cf0\b0 , \cf2\b\strike minimum\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1560\}\cf0\b0 , and \cf2\b\strike angle_of_max_to_x_axis\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1570\}\cf0\b0 .  The default \i Expressions \i0 for them are simply values, 1.0E-3, 1.0E-3, and 0, respectively.  By default, the interpretation method for the layer is \i Nearest\i0 .  If the interpretation method is changed to \i Exact\i0 , a closed contour is drawn, and the \cf2\b\strike maximum\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1540\}\cf0\b0  parameter is assigned a value of 2.0E-3.  The maximum hydraulic conductivity inside the contour will be 2.0E-3, whereas outside the contour it will be 1.0E-3.
\par Separation of the underlying physical information from the simulation model provides a powerful hydrogeologic tool.  The GIS coverages (\i Information \i0 layers) may be used interchangeably for any simulation model coupled with Argus ONE.  For example, if a \i Data \i0 layer is used to specify the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the \b SutraGUI\b0 , the data points in that layer could be exported to a text file and then imported into a MODFLOW model created with the MODFLOW GUI (\cf2\strike Winston, 2000\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Winston00\}\cf0 ).
\par In addition to \i Information \i0 layers, \i Data \i0 layers may be used to store point data.  The main differences between Data layers and \i Information \i0 layers are that, in \i Data \i0 layers: (1) only point data can be used; (2) only real-number data, not integers or other data types, can be used; (3) \i Expressions \i0 cannot be used to set the value of a data point; and (4) only interpolation methods can be used on the point data in contrast with the \i Nearest \i0 and \i Exact \i0 methods.
\par The mesh for the model is stored in a \i Quad Mesh\i0  layer.  Parameters on this layer, for the most part, represent the inputs to the SUTRA model as determined by an interpretation of the \i Information \i0 and \i Data \i0 layers. \f2

\par \cf0\b0\fs20 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\f1\fs24 In SUTRA, the region to be modeled is divided up into \b\i elements\b0\i0 .  These can be either 2D quadrilaterals (fig. 1) or 3D solids with six sides ("generalized hexahedra", fig. 2).  (Strictly speaking, the elements are not hexahedra because the faces can be curved.)  The determinant of the Jacobian matrix of all elements must be positive (Voss and Provost, 2002).  For both 2D and 3D elements, this means that no node can be displaced toward the interior of the element beyond the line or plane defined by its two or three neighboring nodes in the element.  The corners of elements are \b\i nodes\b0\i0 .  2D elements have four nodes (fig. 1) and 3D elements have eight nodes (fig. 2).  The nodes are where values for pressure, saturation, and concentration or temperature of the model are calculated by SUTRA.  Each node is associated with a region termed the \b\i cell\b0\i0 .  The cell associated with any node is made up of portions of all the neighboring elements.  Each element is divided into 4 or 8 pieces depending on whether the element is 2D (fig. 1) or 3D (fig. 2).  Each piece is assigned to its corner node as part of the cell of that node.  \f2

\par \pard\fi720\cf0\f2 The model domain is the spatial region that is included in the model.  A SUTRA simulation may employ either a 2D or 3D domain and mesh.  For a 2D simulation, the domain is a 2D region enclosed by a single continuous boundary.  Internally, there may be holes in the 2D region and each is enclosed by a continuous boundary.  To create a mesh, this domain or region is divided into a set of contiguous finite elements.  If a 2D mesh is used, the mesh created by Argus ONE is the same as the mesh used by SUTRA.  A 2D mesh may be either an irregular mesh or a FishNet Mesh.  An irregular mesh (\cf3\strike for example, fig. 1\cf4\strike0\{linkID=20\}\cf0 ) is the type of mesh normally created by Argus ONE and is described in the Argus ONE User's Guide (Argus Interware, 1997).  A FishNet Mesh (for example, fig. 3) consists of superblocks (large contiguous quadrilaterals) that are each subdivided into a specified number of quadrilateral finite elements, four of which are connected to each internal node.  The mesh may be considered similar to a deformed finite-difference grid.  FishNet meshes are created as described in the section of this report entitled "\cf3\strike FishNet_Mesh_Layout\cf4\strike0\{linkID=1400\}\cf0 ."

\par \cf0\b0\f1\fs24 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\f2 For 3D problems, the X and Y coordinate plane, as viewed on the computer monitor, may be oriented in any direction in space.  However, for most problems, it is recommended that X be directed east, Y north, and Z outward from the screen, representing elevation.
\par A 3D model domain is conceptualized as comprising a stack of one or more tabular units.  Each tabular unit extends across the entire domain in either a subhorizontal or subvertical direction.  Units may represent geologic units or any other geometric features.  The top of the model domain is a curved, uneven, or flat 2D surface.  A 2D surface also defines the bottom of the unit in 3D.  The bottom of each unit also is the top of the unit below it. 
\par Most often, a tabular unit will represent a hydrogeologic unit, although this is not required.  If a unit represents a hydrogeologic unit, and the hydrogeologic unit pinches out within the model domain, the portion of the unit that is outside the area of the hydrogeologic unit should be considered part of a separate hydrogeologic unit and its properties should be consistent with the other unit in those locations.
\par Often, the user may wish to represent a unit with several layers of nodes and elements.  To do so, the user needs to specify the discretization across the unit (referred to here as the 'vertical discretization' though the direction need not be vertical).  The reader is referred to the section of this report entitled "\cf2\strike Structure in Z (3D Only)\cf3\strike0\{linkID=230\}\cf0 " on page \lang1024 29\lang1033  for instructions on how to specify the vertical discretization.  The vertical discretization represents the number of layers of elements represented by the unit.
\par Argus ONE does not provide a method for creating 3D meshes.  \b SutraGUI\b0 , therefore, creates the 3D mesh in memory each time it is needed.  \b SutraGUI \b0 uses one or more 2D meshes created by Argus ONE to represent the 3D mesh. 
\par Note: At present (2003), SUTRA requires that all 3D meshes be FishNet Meshes.  In a FishNet mesh for a 3D model, the nodes must be connected in such a way that the entire mesh can be deformed into a finite-difference grid.
\par The 3D mesh is constructed by allowing layers of nodes to follow along the top of the model domain and along the bottoms of the units.  The layers of nodes that define the boundaries between the units are represented by Quad Mesh layers in Argus ONE.  Between the top and bottom of each unit lie one or more layers of elements (fig. 4) and their nodes.  Vertical Discretization controls the number of layers of elements for each unit.
\par \pard\li720\sb120\i Note: Except for the uppermost unit, each unit extends from the layer of nodes at its bottom up to but not including the layer of nodes at its top.  The uppermost unit includes the layer of nodes at its top.\i0

The nodes marked with red cubes are nodes in Argus ONE two-dimensional meshes indicating the location of the model top and the bottoms of each of the two units.  A. Vertically aligned mesh.  B. Nonaligned mesh.\b0 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 
\par The elevation of nodes in the 3D mesh is determined by the \cf2\b\strike Elevation Top\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2110\}\cf0\b0  and \cf2\b\strike Elevation Bottom Unit[i]\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2280\}\cf0\b0  layers.  Each such layer is used to assign the elevation of the nodes at the top or bottom of a unit.  Nodes in the interior of units are spaced equally between the corresponding nodes on the top and bottom of the unit.
\par If the user chooses a \b vertically aligned\b0  mesh (fig. 4A), only a single Argus ONE 2D quad mesh is used and is projected downwards through the 3D mesh.  Thus, this 3D mesh type consists of nodes and elements that lie directly beneath the nodes and elements in the Argus ONE mesh.  However, the elevations within a layer of nodes can vary, depending on the elevations of the model top and unit bottoms.  The 3D mesh is thus vertically extruded from the 2D mesh.
\par If a \b nonaligned \b0 mesh (fig. 4B) is selected, an Argus ONE Quad Mesh must be specified for the bottom of every unit and for the top of the mesh.  The 2D meshes on these layers must all have the same number of nodes and elements.  In addition, the numbering of the nodes and elements must be the same in each mesh.  For example, if one mesh has 10 rows and 20 columns of elements, the others must also.  If one mesh has its nodes numbered first along rows and then along columns, the others must also.  However, the (X, Y) coordinates of the nodes can vary among meshes.  Methods for creating meshes that meet these requirements are discussed in the section of this report entitled "\cf2\strike FishNet_Mesh_Layout\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1400\}\cf0 " on page \lang1024 42\lang1033 .
\par In \b SutraGUI\b0 , the numbering of nodes and elements in the 3D mesh cannot correspond exactly to the numbering of nodes and elements in the 2D mesh created by Argus ONE.  Each node and element in the 2D mesh corresponds to several nodes and elements in the vertical dimension.  These nodes are numbered sequentially from the top to the bottom of the 3D mesh.  For example, if a mesh had 10 elements in the vertical dimension, element 1 in the 2D mesh would correspond to elements 1-10 in the 3D mesh.  Element 2 in the 2D mesh would correspond to elements 11-20 in the 3D mesh, and so on.  The menu item \b PIEs|Convert Node and Element Numbers\b0  is a command that can be used to convert node and element numbers in the Argus ONE mesh to those of the 3D mesh and vice-versa when such information is needed. \f4

\par \b\f4\fs32 Three-Dimensional Models\b0\f1\fs24 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\cf0\f2 The user defines the distribution of porosity, permeability (or hydraulic conductivity), dispersivity, initial pressure (or initial head), and initial concentration (or initial temperature) for each unit.  Unless the \b Sutra_Z() \b0 or \b Sutra_Layer()\b0  functions (described in the next paragraphs) are used, the properties do not vary vertically within each unit.  (Because pressure changes with elevation, the \b Sutra_Z()\b0  function is often particularly useful in defining specified pressure boundaries and the initial pressure.)
\par The \b Sutra_Z()\b0  function provided by \b SutraGUI \b0 can be used in Expressions to set the values of aquifer properties or boundary conditions based on the Z-coordinate (usually the vertical coordinate) of nodes or element centroids.  The reader is referred to the Argus ONE User's Guide (Argus Interware, 1997) for an explanation of Expressions.  The \b Sutra_Z()\b0  function is only meaningful in 3D models.
\par The \b Sutra_Layer()\b0  function returns the layer number of the current element or node in 3D models. It can be used in the same situations that \b Sutra_Z() \b0 is used.
\par \pard\li720\sb120\i Note: Because the layer number and elevations of the nodes and element centroids are not known except when the input files for SUTRA are generated, values of the \b Sutra_Z()\b0  and \b Sutra_Layer()\b0  function are never given interactively by \b SutraGUI\b0 .  Values of \b Sutra_Z()\b0  and \b Sutra_Layer()\b0  exist only during the actual creation of the SUTRA input files, in other words, during export.\i0 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 The \b Sutra_Z()\b0  and \b Sutra_Layer()\b0  functions can be used for the source terms in boundary condition layers, for the top and bottom elevations in layers relating to solids and for any of the aquifer properties that are set by node or by element.  Table 1 is a complete listing of the layers and parameters for which the \b Sutra_Z() \b0 and \b Sutra_Layer()\b0  functions are valid.  If one of the parameters in table 1 is linked to any other parameter, including ones not in table 1, and the other parameter employs \b Sutra_Z()\b0  or\b  Sutra_Layer()\b0 , \b Sutra_Z()\b0  or\b  Sutra_Layer()\b0  will be evaluated correctly during export of the parts of the SUTRA input files related to the parameters in table 1.

\par \pard\keep\fi720\sb120\cf0\f2 All the boundary conditions and the locations of observation points can be set on layers similar to those used for 2D models.  These objects can only be located within the model top and within the bottom surfaces of any model unit in 3D.  As in 2D models, these objects must lie directly above nodes or must enclose nodes.
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 In addition, all boundary conditions can be set using 3D objects, which may be placed anywhere in the 3D domain of the model, within individual units or crossing several units.  By itself, Argus ONE does not define 3D objects; it only provides 2D objects.  The user can define the shape of the projection of a 3D object on the top of the model and the top and bottom elevations of the object.  Any 3D object shape can be constructed in this way using a combination of one or more such objects.
\par 3D objects are defined in SutraGUI using the Argus ONE 2D objects, but additional information must be supplied about the Z-coordinates of the objects.  This is done using the parameters defined for each information layer in Argus ONE where 3D objects are defined.  There are five types of 3D objects: points, lines, vertical sheets, slanted sheets, and solids.  The relations between the 3D objects and the corresponding 2D Argus ONE contours are shown in Table \lang1024 2\lang1033 .\f3

This is in contrast with 2D models, where only nodes directly above the contours themselves are selected.  Boundary conditions or observation nodes need not lie exactly above or within contours (objects) in 3D models.

\par \pard\keep\fi720\sb120 If \b follow_mesh\b0  is 'true' for lines, the location of the open contour used to define the line is treated as follows.  In the uppermost Argus ONE mesh layer, all the nodes whose 2D cells intersect the contour are identified.  The contour is treated as if it was aligned with the X and Y coordinates of those nodes.  Then it is moved down along a column of nodes to a location where the Z-coordinate matches the Z-coordinate of the original line.  In the process, the X and Y coordinates are also adjusted.  This new line contour is then evaluated in the usual manner (fig. 9).  Thus, when the user specifies a line object on the model top or on any unit bottom, the object is moved up or down to the user-specified elevation along vertical columns of nodes in the mesh.
\par \pard\fi720 For nodes at the outer edge of the mesh, this process can lead to lines that lie just outside the mesh and only just touch the mesh along the edges of elements.  In such cases, the line would not select any nodes because the line would not be inside the element.  Therefore, it is best to avoid setting the \b follow_mesh\b0  parameter to 'true' for lines near the edge of the mesh.  In such cases, solids should be used instead.\cf2\f1

A new set of sheets is constructed that comprises the faces of all 3D elements that are in the same column of nodes as the selected nodes on the uppermost 2D mesh.  These new sheet contours are then evaluated in the usual manner (fig. 10).  As with lines, described just above, this method should not be used at the outer edge of the mesh.

It also allows the user to edit this project information at any time from within the Argus ONE environment.  (Input of the spatially dependent information is done in geospatial information layers accessible from the standard Argus ONE window after exiting from the \b SUTRA Project Information\b0  dialog box.)  
\par The data in the \b SUTRA Project Information \b0 dialog box appears on a number of separate panes.  A list of the panes appears on the left side of the dialog box.

\par Most of the information to be entered in the \b SUTRA Project Information \b0 dialog box is required in SUTRA input data sets, and with a few exceptions, appears in the same order as normally found in a SUTRA input data set, as described in the SUTRA documentation (\cf2\strike Voss and Provost, 2002\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Voss02\}\cf0 ).  The 'initial time' from the SUTRA initial conditions input data set also appears here.
\par A pane may be accessed by clicking on the pane's title, listed along the left edge of the dialog box.

The \b SutraGUI \b0 Help system can also be used to find out about the parameters in the \b SUTRA Project Information\b0  dialog box.  One way to access the Help system for a particular control is to select the control (such as an edit box or check box) and press the F1 button on the keyboard.  The reader is referred to the section of this report entitled "\cf2\strike Accessing Online Help\cf3\strike0\{linkID=7\}\cf0 " on page \lang1024 5\lang1033  for more information.

If \b Cancel \b0 is selected during the creation of a new SUTRA project, then the creation of that new project is canceled.  Because default values are supplied for all parameters, it may not be necessary to access all of the panes in the \b SUTRA Project Information \b0 dialog box before closing it.

\par \cf0\b0\fs20 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\f1\fs24 The \b Model Configuration \b0 pane allows the user to do the following:
\par \pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li920\sb120\tx920 choose the type of simulation problem to be solved with SUTRA,

\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}set names of layers and parameters to be appropriate for the chosen problem type. 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 For example, an areal problem using head will include an information layer called \b Hydraulic Conductivity \b0 and refer to "Hydraulic Head" whereas a cross-sectional problem with variable-density fluid will have a layer called \b Permeability \b0 and refer to "Pressure".  An unsaturated problem will include an information layer called \b Unsaturated Properties \b0 but a saturated-only problem will not have such an information layer.
\par The SUTRA code solves general equations for flow and transport allowing much flexibility in problem type.  This is reflected in the choices available in the SUTRA Configuration pane.  Internally, the SUTRA code works with its original set of variables, pressure and permeability, but for the model setup, \b SutraGUI \b0 can translate these into the simpler quantities hydraulic head and hydraulic conductivity for ease of use.  Should the user prefer to work with the original SUTRA variables, and have access to all possible information layers for SUTRA at once, the "General" option should be selected.  Should the user prefer to configure \b SutraGUI \b0 for a certain type of problem, the "Specific" option should be selected.  This makes available a set of choices to the user in the lower portion of the window, allowing the user to specify the problem type, and the type of meshing. \f2

\par \b AREAL \b0 models are 2D, perfectly horizontal models for constant-density solute transport under saturated conditions (for example, used for typical contaminant plume problems or tracking of natural tracers).
\par \b CROSS-SECTIONAL OR DIPPED\b0  models are 2D, vertical cross-sectional models, or non-horizontal models that potentially allow unsaturated conditions with variable-density solute or energy transport.  The gravity vector components in such non-horizontal models can be non-zero, in contrast with \b AREAL \b0 models, in which gravity components are always set to zero.  The gravity components for \b CROSS-SECTIONAL OR DIPPED\b0  models would be set to zero if the user is solving for hydraulic head, rather than pressure.
\par \b THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL (VERTICALLY ALIGNED)\b0   models are 3D models in which the X and Y coordinates of all the nodes in each layer of the mesh are at the same X and Y coordinates as the corresponding nodes in all the other layers.

It is used to control the number of model units in the Z-direction and the discretization and vertical spacing within each unit in the Z-direction.  Most often in a 3D model, each unit will be a hydrogeologic unit and the Z-direction will be the vertical direction (vertically upwards).  
\par The \b Name\b0  is provided for the convenience of the user in identifying how Units in SutraGUI relate to the aquifers being modeled.
\par The \b Z Discretization\b0  is the number of elements in the vertical direction used to simulate a particular unit.
\par The \b Element growth rate\b0  and \b Growth type\b0  control how the vertical size of elements will change within a unit.  For example if \b Growth type \b0 is \b Grow downward\b0 , each successively lower element within a unit will be the size of the one above it times the \b Element growth rate\b0 .  Of course, this does not apply to the uppermost element within a unit.  For example if the thickness of a unit is 1, the vertical discretization is 2 and the element growth rate is 1.5. The upper element within the unit will have a thickness of 0.4 and the lower one will have a thickness of 0.6 (= 0.4 * 1.5).  The element growth rate typically varies between 0.67 to 1.5.  The element growth rate only has an effect if the discretization is greater than 1.
\par The number of units can be changed either by changing the number displayed in the edit box labeled \b Number of units\b0  or by clicking on the \b Delete\b0 , \b Insert\b0 , or \b Add \b0 buttons.  Clicking the \b Add \b0 button will add one unit at the bottom of the layer structure.  Clicking the \b Delete \b0 button will delete the selected unit.

Thus, the user may choose to specify boundary conditions, sources, or observations in two ways: those that occur exactly on the top or bottom surfaces of units, and those that occur (as 3D objects) anywhere in the 3D model domain.
\par '3D Objects' - Boundary conditions, sources, and observations that are not exactly located on the top or bottom surfaces of units may be specified as any of five types of 3D objects, \cf2\b\strike points\cf3\strike0\{linkID=60\}\cf0\b0 , \cf2\b\strike lines\cf3\strike0\{linkID=70\}\cf0\b0 , \cf2\b\strike vertical sheets\cf3\strike0\{linkID=80\}\cf0\b0 , \cf2\b\strike slanted sheets\cf3\strike0\{linkID=80\}\cf0\b0 , and \cf2\strike solids\cf3\strike0\{linkID=90\}\cf0  (for example, points, lines and solids may be used to represent wells).  The table on the upper half of the pane allows the user to select the number of Argus ONE layers for each type of object and each type of condition.  The table lists the type of 3D object in separate columns and the type of condition to specify in separate rows.  The user should specify the number of the Argus ONE layers to be created for each object in the appropriate cell of the table.  The layers appear in Argus ONE after \b OK \b0 is clicked.  The layers may be removed by specifying the value, '0', and the number of layers can be changed at any time.  \ul Information in removed layers is lost.
\par \pard\li720\sb120\ulnone\i Note: The reason for possibly needing multiple Argus ONE layers for the same 3D object is as follows.  Argus ONE allows the user to draw the location of a 3D object only in 2D map view.  Argus ONE does not allow contours describing objects to overlap.  If the same condition is required at various Z coordinates, but the objects overlap when seen in map view, each overlapping object must be defined in its own Argus ONE layer to avoid overlap in any layer.\i0   
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 'In-Surfaces' - The lower half of the pane concerns boundary conditions, sources, and observations that are located exactly within the top or bottom surfaces of units (for example, recharge at the top of the model, in the \cf2\b\strike Sources of Fluid Top\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1700\}\cf0\b0  layer).  The tree control in the lower half of the pane has a list of units.  Within each unit, there is a list of the Argus ONE layers that can appear on the top or bottom of the unit.  These layers allow the user to specify boundary conditions, sources, and observations on the tops or bottoms of units.  The list of layers may be displayed by clicking the plus sign next to the unit.  If the check box next to a layer name is checked, an Argus ONE layer with that name will be included in Argus ONE layer structure after \b OK \b0 button is clicked.  These layers can be removed from the Argus ONE layer structure by unchecking the check box.  Information in removed layers is lost. 
\par \pard\keep\li720\sb120\i  Note: Each unit in a 3D SUTRA model has an upper and lower surface.  Each of these surfaces need not be a horizontal plane, and may vary in elevation along the surface.  The top of each unit is exactly the same surface as the bottom of the unit above it.  Because of this, the complete list of Argus ONE layers includes only the bottoms of all units and  the top of the uppermost unit (the top of the model domain).\i0

Ideal selection of the GNUP will cause the simulated pressure to match specified values of pressure at the boundaries to match to six or seven decimal places.  Ideal selection of the GNUU will do the same for temperature or concentration.

\par \pard\fi720\f1\fs24 The \b Temporal Controls\b0  pane is only available if either flow or transport is \cf2\strike transient\cf3\strike0\{linkID=240\}\cf0 .  The controls in the \b Temporal Control and Solution Cycling Data\b0  pane determine the duration of the simulation, the size of the time steps, and the cycling of flow and transport solutions and the starting time of the simulation.
\par 
\par The \b Time Units\b0  for the model can be set to seconds, minutes, hours, days, months and years.  For the purposes of SutraGUI, a year is exactly 365.25 days and a month is on twelfth of a year.  Where a variable with units of time are specified in SutraGUI, that variable will be converted to seconds in the SUTRA input file because SUTRA only recognizes seconds as a time unit. \f2 
\par \pard 
\par \pard\fi720\b\f1 Simulation Starting Time\b0  is the elapsed time at which the initial conditions for simulation are specified.  For a cold start, this is usually 0 but it may also be set to a particular starting year (specified in the selected time units).  Argus ONE writes this value to the SUTRA input data set.
\par \pard\f2 
\par \pard\fi720\f3 The times specified in SutraGUI may be either \b ABSOLUTE\b0  or \b ELAPSED\b0 .  With Elapsed time, the the starting point of the model is considered to be time zero whereas with Absolute time, time zero is at an arbitrary time.\f2 
\par \pard 
\par \pard\fi720\f3 There are two methods of specifying the number of time steps and their lengths in SUTRA, a \b Time Cycle\b0  and a \b Time List\b0 . 
\par \pard 
\par \pard\fi720\f1 With a \b\f3 Time Cycle\b0  the total duration of the model is limited either by \b NTMAX \b0 or \b TIMEL\b0 . The user also specifies an initial time step size (\b TIMEC\b0 ).  If the user specifies a time step multiplier (\b TCMULT\b0 ) greater than 1, the time step size will increase by a factor of \b TCMULT\b0  every time a time step change cycle (\b NTCYC\b0 ) is completed until the maximum time step size (\b TCMAX\b0 ) is reached.  If the user specifies a time step multiplier (\b TCMULT\b0 ) less than 1, the time step size will decrease by a factor of \b TCMULT\b0  every time a time step change cycle (\b NTCYC\b0 ) is completed until the minimum time step size (\b TCMIN\b0 ) is reached.
\par 
\par With a \b Time List\b0 , the user specifies the number of time steps and the ending time of each time step.  (The times schedule that is exported will also include a zero as the starting time of the first time step.)  The user can specify the ending times by typing them individually into the table or by copying the times in a block from a spreadsheet program and pasting them into the table.\f2 
\par \pard 
\par \pard\fi720\f3 SUTRA does not have to calculate both the pressure solution and the temperature/concentration solution at every time step.  One or the other can be simulated less frequently.  \b NPCYC\b0  and \b NUCYC\b0  are used to control which (if either) is simulated less frequently.  However, at least one of them must be set to one.\f2

\par 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\f2 The controls on the \b Initial Condition Controls\b0  pane allow users to specify how to use SUTRA restart files as initial conditions for a simulation.
\par 
\par The radio buttons under \b Read initial conditions from restart file\b0  determine how the restart file will be used.  By default, the file is not read.  The user may select to read the pressure, concentration (or energy), or both from the restart file.  When initial conditions are read from the restart file, the information in the respective Argus ONE initial conditions information layer is ignored when preparing the SUTRA input files.
\par For 3D models, the user also has the option of interpolating pressure and/or concentration (or energy) results from a simulation on a previously used mesh for use as initial conditions for a new mesh.  Finite-element basis functions (equivalent to those used in SUTRA) are used for interpolations to locations that are inside the old mesh.  For locations outside the old mesh, the average value at the four nearest nodes in the old mesh is used.  Generally, this option would be used to set the initial conditions after refining the mesh.  It may require a long execution time by \b SutraGUI\b0 .
\par \pard\fi720 For 2D models, a similar effect can be accomplished by using an Argus ONE expression to link the initial conditions to data imported into Argus ONE in the process of creating a contour map or other post-processing chart, although Argus ONE interpolation, rather than finite-element interpolation would be used in this case.
\par In 3D models, the layers \cf2\strike Initial Pressure Override Unit[i]/Initial Hydraulic Head Override Unit[i]\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2265\}\cf0  and \cf2\strike Initial Concentration Override Unit[i]/Initial Temperature Override Unit[i]\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2275\}\cf0  can be used to override values read or interpolated from the restart file.

\par \f2 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 The \b Parameter Values - Quick Set\b0  button at the bottom of the \b SUTRA Project Information\b0  dialog box opens a separate dialog box that is used to set the values of Argus ONE parameters quickly without entering the Argus ONE Layers dialog box.  This is convenient, particularly when the same value has to be set for a given parameter in many units in a 3D model (for example, hydraulic conductivity).  For new models (before the \b SUTRA Project Information \b0 dialog box is exited the first time by clicking \b OK\b0 ), the value that is entered is the value that will be used.  For existing models, it is necessary to click on the \b Set Now \b0 button to the left of the appropriate edit box to set the parameter value.  The \b Set Now \b0 button will appear in \b bold text \b0 indicating that it needs to be clicked in order to set the value, and after clicking, the text reverts to the normal font. 
\par \pard\li720\i Note: It is possible to use Argus ONE expressions, rather than numbers, as values in the boxes.  It is advisable to create the expression within the Argus ONE Expression editor for a parameter (found in the Layers dialog) so that the expression has correct syntax, and then copy it into the desired box of the \b Parameter Values - Quick Set \b0 pane.  Incorrect values entered in the \b Parameter Values -Quick Set \b0 pane will appear as expressions in the Layers dialog box and will give incorrect results.  The reader is referred to the Argus ONE User's Guide (Argus Interware, 1997) and Winston (2001) for methods of setting parameter Expressions.\i0\f1

Only controls that are specifically related to use of the interface for SUTRA simulations are described in this report.
\par At this point, there will actually be two overlaid windows, the original "Untitled" window, and a new "Untitled1" window that contains the layer structure for a SUTRA model.  The user may wish to close or minimize the original "Untitled" window so as not to confuse the two.
\par For convenience, the new "Untitled1" window may be maximized to full screen by clicking the maximize button containing an upward pointing triangle in the upper-right corner of the window.  The appearance of this button may vary depending on the operating system being used.
\par Prior to creating or importing information in geospatial information layers, the user should decide on and possibly specify the drawing size of the workspace, and the scale and units of the modeling project.  These project parameters can also be changed automatically when importing information that extends beyond the specified ranges.
\par This information can be entered from the \i Drawing Size...\i0  and \i Scale and Units...\i0  commands in the \i Special \i0 pull-down menu found along the top of the Argus ONE window.  
\par \pard\keep\li720\sb120\i Note: the view of the workspace may be exaggerated or reduced in either direction by selecting Non-uniform: in the Scale and Units dialog box.  This is often required for cross-sectional models.  Note that this also affects the shape of elements generated in an irregular mesh.\i0 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\b SutraGUI \b0 assumes that all data are referenced to the same reference elevation or datum.  For areal problems, the datum is arbitrary.  For cross-sectional problems, the datum is given by the coordinate system selected by the user in the \i Scale and Units...\i0  commands in the \i Special \i0 pull-down menu along the top of the Argus ONE window.  For 3D problems, the X and Y coordinate plane, as viewed on the monitor, may be oriented in any direction in space.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\b\f0\fs32 SUTRA Mesh
\par 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\cf0\b0\f1\fs24 The \b SUTRA Mesh \b0 layer is the layer on which the mesh used in the model is defined.  For 2D models, the mesh on a \b SUTRA Mesh \b0 layer can be either an irregular mesh or a "FishNet" mesh.  The FishNet mesh case is described in the section of this report entitled "\cf2\strike FishNet_Mesh_Layout\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1400\}\cf0 " on page \lang1024 42\lang1033 .
\par An irregular mesh can be generated automatically using the magic wand tool from the tool palette at the left side of the Argus ONE window as discussed in the Argus ONE User's Guide (\cf2\strike Argus Interware, 1997\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 ).  The User's Guide also explains how to inspect nodal and element geometries and parameters, to move nodes, and to override (change) node or element parameter values that were automatically assigned by Argus ONE.  To generate an Irregular Mesh, make the \b SUTRA Mesh \b0 layer active, click on the magic wand tool, and then click the magic wand cursor within the area of the domain boundary.  Argus ONE then generates a mesh according to the density information contained in the \b Domain Outline \b0 layer and, if specified, in the \b Mesh Density \b0 layer.
\par If a mesh already exists in the layer, then the user is prompted to accept deletion of all existing elements before the new mesh is generated.  If the view has been rescaled by user selection of \i Non-uniform \i0 in the Argus ONE \i Scale and Units \i0 dialog box, then elongated elements are produced in an irregular mesh.  Horizontally long elements are often appropriate for cross-sectional modeling of aquifer systems.
\par In some cases, elements with very small or very large angles may be created during the meshing process.  Such elements can be found by selecting \i Edit|Select Acute Elements\i0 .  If some exist, the mesh may be manually adjusted or the meshing preferences, which control a scan for odd-shaped elements, may be changed by selecting \i Special|Preferences \i0 and changing some of the items in the dialog box.
\par In 2D models, the \b SUTRA Mesh \b0 layer contains values for all of the spatially distributed parameters required for running a SUTRA simulation, through references to and functions of the other layers.  In 3D models, the \b SUTRA Mesh \b0 layer or layers contains values of all the spatially distributed parameters except boundary conditions and observations.  Depending on SUTRA's requirements for each parameter, as specified in the documentation for the SUTRA input data sets (\cf2\strike Voss and Provost, 2002\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Voss02\}\cf0 ), a parameter may receive a value for each node or for each element in the mesh.  These values are derived from the various \i Information \i0 layers described in following sections.  The Argus ONE environment refers to the assignment of values in one \i Information \i0 layer to another as "linking."  The names of the parameters of the \b SUTRA Mesh \b0 layer are listed in Table \lang1024 8\lang1033 .  The full Argus ONE name of each parameter is given as "Layer.Parameter," for example, the first parameter, \b NREG\b0 , in the table is \b SUTRA Mesh.NREG\b0 .
\par The uppercase names of \b SUTRA Mesh \b0 parameters correspond exactly with variables used by the SUTRA model, and are described in the SUTRA documentation.  There is one exception to the above.  The SUTRA parameter, \b UBC\b0 , representing the concentration or temperature of any fluid that may flow into the model at a node where pressure or hydraulic head is specified, has been changed to \b pUBC \b0 in \b SutraGUI \b0 to distinguish it from the specified concentration or temperature boundary condition type, which retains its original name (\b UBC\b0 ).
\par Two of the \b SUTRA Mesh \b0 parameters, \b QIN \b0 and \b QUIN\b0 , a fluid source and energy or solute source, respectively, have additional logic associated with their values.  As noted in the description of the \b Sources of Fluid\b0  and \b Sources of Energy \b0 or \b Sources of Solute\b0  layers, to which these node-wise parameters are linked, these sources may be specified at point, line (open) or closed contours.  Depending on which type of contour is specified in the "\b Sources\b0 " layer, the resultant source value provided as a parameter in the "\b Sources\b0 " layer may require multiplication by the open contour length or closed contour area associated with the node; these multiplications are carried out automatically.
\par The \b Z \b0 parameter on the \b SUTRA Mesh \b0 layer represents the thickness of the model.

\par \f1\fs24 The \b FishNet_Mesh_Layout \b0 layer is included only when it is selected in the \b SUTRA Project Information \b0 dialog box.  \b SutraGUI\b0 , rather than Argus ONE, creates FishNet meshes.  A FishNet Mesh consists of superblocks (large contiguous quadrilaterals) each subdivided into a specified number of rows and columns of quadrilateral finite elements.  This layer, like the \cf2\b\strike SUTRA Mesh\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1060\} \cf0\b0 layer, is a Quad-Mesh layer.  However, the elements on it must be drawn manually or imported, rather than being generated automatically by Argus ONE.  Each element of the mesh will describe one "superblock" of the \cf2\b\strike SUTRA Mesh\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1060\}\cf0\b0 .  The "superblocks" describe the external and internal boundaries of the FishNet Mesh.  Each superblock element contains information describing the desired number of quadrilateral finite elements that will fill the superblock in the X and Y directions when the mesh is generated.  The use of the \b FishNet_Mesh_Layout\b0  layer is described in the section of this report entitled "\cf2\strike Creating FishNet Meshes\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2320\}\cf0 " on page \lang1024 68\lang1033 .

\par \pard\fi720\f1\fs24 The \b Domain Outline \b0 is a special Argus ONE layer type used to define the maximum areal extent of the simulated region when an irregular mesh is used.  The outermost contour on the \b Domain Outline \b0 will exactly contain the entire finite-element mesh that is generated.  Any closed contours inside the outermost one will represent areas where no mesh will be generated (fig. 13).  Geospatial information coverage in other layers is required everywhere within the domain outline for the finite-element mesh, and may extend areally beyond the domain outline.  If a FishNet mesh is used, SutraGUI does not need a \b Domain Outline \b0 layer but one is still needed by Argus ONE.  In such cases, the layer is renamed \b unused layer1\b0 .

\par \pard\fi720 
\par \pard\keep\fi720\sb120 The contours in the \b Domain Outline \b0 layer contain information controlling the size of finite-elements in an irregular mesh.  The \b element_size \b0 defines the desired nominal size of elements in the discretization.  This information, in conjunction with the layer \b Mesh Density \b0 and the geometry of objects in these layers, determines the distribution and size of mesh elements.  Mesh density is strongly affected by the proximity of contours and the size of contour segments, as described in the Argus ONE User's Guide (\cf3\strike Argus Interware, 1997\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 ).  (The \b Mesh Density \b0 layer is usually used to refine the discretization in select areas of the model domain and is described below.)
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 Point and open contours may be specified in the \b Domain Outline\b0  layer.  Although these do not determine the external boundaries of the mesh, they may be used to define the nominal size of elements along these objects.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\b\f0\fs32 How to specify geologic units in cross-sectional models\cf0\b0\f1\fs24 
\par 
\par In two-dimensional, cross-sectional models, it may sometimes be desireable to have the boundaries between geologic units lie along element boundaries.  This is easy to do with \cf2\strike Fishnet meshes\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1400\}\cf0  but a method for creating an irregular mesh with the same constraint is less obvious.  Here is one way to do it.
\par 
\par 1. On the \cf2\strike Domain Outline\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1430\}\cf0  layer, create a closed contour that outlines one of the geologic units and assign it the \cf2\strike element_size\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1460\}\cf0  that you desire.
\par 2. Draw a closed contour around a neighboring  geologic unit but separate it from the previous geologic unit by the width of one or two elements.  Continue until you have outline each geologic unit.
\par 3. In the mesh layer, click with the magic-wand tool inside each closed contour to create a portion of the final mesh.
\par 4. Select "Special|Preferences" and change the "minimal allowed angle for elements" from 22.5 to 0 and the "Maximal allowed elements for elements" from 165 to 360.
\par 5. Use the Element drawing tool from the Argus ONE tool palette to draw additional elements connecting the separated parts of the mesh as shown below.
\par 
\par \cf3\{bmc NewElements.BMP\}\cf0 
\par 
\par 6. The manually drawn elements may not be properly shaped. For example, they may contain angles greater than 180 degrees.  Once the elements have been drawn try to move the nodes to improve the shapes of the elements.  One way to do this is to select all the nodes between the two geologic units and then select "Special|Smooth Elements" as illustrated below.  (In some cases, it helps to do this several times.)   When doing this, be sure not to select any nodes that must lie on the boundary between the geologic units or over point or open contours that must lie directly under nodes.
\par 
\par \cf3\{bmc InteriorNodes.BMP\}
\par \{bmc SmoothedElements.BMP\}\cf0 
\par 
\par 7. Next select "Special|Preferences" and change the "minimal allowed angle for elements" back to 22.5 and the "Maximal allowed elements for elements" back to 165 (or to other values that you choose).
\par 8. To find elements that are misformed, select "Edit|Select Acute Elements". If there are elements that are misformed, edit them to make them acceptable.
\par 9. Select "Special|Renumber...", check the "Optimize Bandwidth" check box and click the "OK" button.

\par \cf0\b0\f1\fs24 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\b\f2 Mesh Density\b0  is an Argus ONE Information layer that is used by the \cf2\b\strike SUTRA Mesh\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1060\}\cf0\b0  layer to define the refinement of the finite-element mesh in an irregular mesh (in addition to the \cf2\b\strike element_size\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1460\}\cf0\b0  information contained in the \cf2\b\strike Domain Outline\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1430\}\cf0\b0  layer).  This layer may contain point contours (that is, points), open contours, and closed contours representing the spatial distribution of \cf2\b\strike element_size\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1460\}\cf0\b0  desired by the user.  Each contour has a value of the element_size associated with it and together, the contours on the \cf2\b\strike Domain Outline\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1430\}\cf0\b0  and \b Mesh Density\b0  layers (together with parameters in the Argus ONE \i Preferences \i0 dialog box regarding meshing preferences) define the \cf2\b\strike element_size\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1460\}\cf0\b0  throughout the mesh.  If a FishNet mesh is used, \b SutraGUI \b0 does not need a \b Mesh Density\b0  layer but one is still needed by Argus ONE.  In such cases, the layer is renamed \b unused layer2\b0 .
\par When regions where increased or decreased discretization within the model domain are desired by the user, the spatial distribution of \cf2\b\strike element_size\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1460\}\cf0\b0  may be defined in the \b Mesh Density\b0  layer.  The \cf2\b\strike element_size\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1460\}\cf0\b0  along the domain boundary will still be based on the value and node-spacing in the \cf2\b\strike Domain Outline\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1430\}\cf0\b0  layer.
\par \pard\fi720 When the \b Mesh Density\b0  layer is active, as with all \i Information \i0 layers, the spatial distribution of \cf2\b\strike element_size\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1460\}\cf0\b0  may be imported from TEXT, DXF or ArcView Shape files.  Alternatively, the point, line, and closed contour tools may be used to specify the approximate size of quadrilateral elements in regions of the modeled domain.  After using one of the contour tools to draw a contour, the \i Contour Information\i0  dialog box appears where the \cf2\b\strike element_size\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1460\}\cf0\b0  is entered; the \cf2\b\strike element_size\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1460\}\cf0\b0  is the desired size of the quadrilateral elements in project units, prescribed at the contour just drawn.  Examples of using the \b Mesh Density\b0  layer to specify the finite-element discretization may be found in the Argus ONE User's Guide (\cf2\strike Argus Interware, 1997\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 ).  If the \b Mesh Density\b0  layer contains no contours (no objects), then the \cf2\b\strike element_size\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1460\}\cf0\b0  specified for contours in the layer, \cf2\b\strike Domain Outline\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1430\}\cf0\b0 , is used in creating the mesh and the \b Mesh Density\b0  layer is ignored.

As described in the SUTRA documentation, this output provides a detailed time series of pressure, concentration, or temperature, and saturation at user-selected nodes at a user-selected time-step interval.  This type of output is used for plotting time-draw down curves or solute breakthrough curves.  \b GW_Chart\b0  (\cf2\strike Winston, 2000\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Winston00\}\cf0 ) can be used to prepare such charts (called 'hydrographs' in \b GW_Chart\b0 ) from the output.
\par It is possible to use point, open, or closed contours to specify where observations should be made during the SUTRA simulation.  For each contour object, the value of the contour's parameter, \b is_observed\b0 , must be set to "True" (or 1).  The frequency of the observations is specified in the \cf2\b\strike Output Controls\cf3\strike0\{linkID=260\}\cf0  \b0 pane of the \b SUTRA Project Information \b0 dialog box.
\par The \b SUTRA Observation\b0  layer uses the Exact Contour method of interpretation so that observations are only defined inside of closed contours, or directly above open and point contours.
\par Nodes in the \cf2\b\strike SUTRA Mesh\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1060\}\cf0\b0  layer falling within the selected areas or directly above the open or points contours will be marked as observation nodes for input to SUTRA.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\b\f0\fs32 GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION LAYERS
\par \cf0\b0\f1\fs24 
\par \f2 The geology and hydrology of an area are stored in Argus ONE as two-dimensional maps of the various parameters. These coverages are referred to as Geospatial Information layers and the specific ones used by the Argus-SUTRA GUI are described below. Separation of the underlying physical information from the simulation model provides a powerful hydrogeologic tool. The GIS coverages, described below and prepared for SUTRA simulation, may be used interchangeably for any simulation model coupled with Argus ONE.
\par 
\par The Geospatial Information layers in the Argus-SUTRA GUI in layer groups Hydrogeology and Initial Conditions, are initially assigned the interpretation method Nearest Contour method. The layer groups Hydrologic Sources and Hydrologic Boundaries are assigned the interpretation method Exact Contour method. An exception to the groupings mentioned above is layer Unsaturated Properties in layer group Hydrogeology, which is assigned the Exact Contour method. 
\par 
\par Some user experimentation with the interpretation methods may be necessary in order to achieve the best possible spatial distribution for a given parameter.
\par 
\par The Geospatial Information layers for the Argus-SUTRA GUI are grouped below by general type: \cf2\strike Hydrogeology\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1500\}\cf0 , \cf2\strike Hydrologic Sources\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1690\}\cf0 , \cf2\strike Hydrologic Boundaries\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1820\}\cf0 , and \cf2\strike Initial Conditions\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1900\}\cf0 . Each group contains a number of layers, each layer contains one or more parameters. After introduction of each parameter in the following sections, units are given for the parameter in square brackets; for example, for Permeability.maximum, the units are given as [L^2 ] representing arbitrary length-units squared. \cf2\strike Table 5\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1030\}\cf0  shows units used and displayed in the GUI with their meanings.
\par 
\par Parameter names such as Fluid Sources.RESULTANT_FLUID_SOURCE, that are uppercase, are calculated, or linked to other layer parameters and should not be modified directly. In most cases modifications to such parameters can be done by changing the lowercase parameters of the layers. Advanced users who understand the functions or references in these parameters may modify them to suit specific modeling needs. New users should consider parameters with uppercase names as "read-only" variables. Section "\cf2\strike Adding and Linking New Layers\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2380\}\cf0 " explains how to add new layers and link the information from these layers into a SUTRA project.
\par 
\par Depending on the choice of problem type made by the user in the SUTRA Interface Configuration window, some of the layer and parameter names and the units of the parameters will be different. All of the variations are included in the descriptions that follow.
\par 
\par Each parameter of each layer is assigned a default value by the SUTRA PIE. The background value specifies a constant value of a parameter for the entire workspace that will be assumed in case no other user input is provided to that parameter.

\par \cf0\b0\f2\fs24 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\f3 The \b Unsaturated Properties\b0  layer is used to specify regions that have different unsaturated flow properties.  
\par \pard\li720\sb120\i Note: Unsaturated-flow simulation with SUTRA requires some \ul user programming\ulnone  in the SUTRA subroutine UNSAT for the user to specify the unsaturated functions for each region as described in \cf2\strike Voss and Provost (2002)\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Voss02\}\cf0 .  The FORTRAN source code for SUTRA and a FORTRAN compiler are required to use this feature.  Because there is not a standard format for any additional information that must be read into the program for unsaturated properties, \b SutraGUI \b0 does not create input files for unsaturated flow properties.  However, users may be able to create an export template for use within Argus ONE that will generate such files for their particular case, as described on p. 169-188 of the Argus ONE User's Guide (\cf2\strike Argus Interware Inc., 1997\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 ).\i0 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 The \b Unsaturated Properties\b0  layer contains information on the spatial distribution of regions having constant unsaturated properties in the unit to be modeled, or for generic studies, in the medium to be modeled.  This layer only appears when a saturated-unsaturated problem type has been selected in the \cf2\b\strike Model Configuration\cf3\strike0\{linkID=160\}\cf0\b0  pane of the \b SUTRA Project Information\b0  dialog box.  The layer contains only one parameter, region (an integer), which contains the identification number of the region.  Usually the \i Exact Contour\i0  method should be used to define the location of regions in this layer, in which case only closed contours should be used for specifying regions.  The \i Exact Contour\i0  method is already specified as the default selection for this layer.  After closing a contour, the user must assign its region number in the \i Contour Information\i0  dialog box.  Any number of contours may share the same region number.  Each region represents one type of material having uniform unsaturated property functions.  For example, region 1 may be fine silt, region 2 may be clay, and region 3 may be coarse sand.  Each type of material may occur in a number of places within the model domain.  The default region number is zero.  To create regions that share a boundary (such as geologic layers), turn on the option \i Special|Allow Intersection\i0  before drawing contours.  If the user wishes to have nodes and element edges occur exactly at region boundaries, then for a FishNet Mesh, these boundaries need to be defined as the edges of superblocks in a \cf2\b\strike FishNet Mesh\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1400\}\cf0\b0  layout.  For an irregular mesh, these must be defined as open contours in the \cf2\b\strike Domain Outline\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1430\}\cf0\b0  layer.  
\par \pard\li720\sb120\i Note: The Argus ONE irregular meshing engine fills only the outermost closed contour on the \b Domain Outline \b0 layer with elements.  Any interior closed contours are left empty (fig. 14).  The recommended procedure is to define a nearly closed open contour in which the distance between the ends of the contour and the outside closed domain boundary contour is roughly the length of the side of a typical element.\f4

\par 
\par \pard\keep\fi720\sb120\f1\fs24 The \b Hydrologic Sources\b0  group of Information layers contains information on fluxes (quantity per time) of fluid, solute, and energy entering or leaving the 2D model domain.  In these layers, \b SutraGUI \b0 allows specification of fluid sources or sinks and energy/solute sources or sinks at points, along line segments, and for delimited areas.  Sources have positive values, whereas sinks are specified with a negative number.  Sources of fluid may be either specified as a total amount of fluid per second (that is, \cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0 ), or as the total amount of fluid per second per length or area of the source object (that is, \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0 ).  Similarly, sources of energy/solute may be either specified as a total amount of energy/solute per second (that is, \cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0 ), or as the total amount of energy/solute per second per length or per area of the source object (that is, \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0 ).  
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 Point sources may be assigned only a \cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0 .  These are created with the point contour drawing tool located along the left side of the Argus ONE window.  Point sources typically represent injection or withdrawal wells for fluid sources.  For irregular meshes, the points representing point sources must be copied to the \cf2\b\strike Domain Outline\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1430\}\cf0\b0  layer to force a node in the finite element mesh to be located at each point source when the mesh is regenerated.  Alternatively, the command \b PIEs|Convert\'85|Mesh Objects to Contours\'85\b0  in the Utility PIE (\cf2\strike Winston, 2001\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Winston01\}\cf0 ) can be used to copy nodes into information layers as point contours.  FishNet meshes must be designed such that the nodes fall exactly at the source locations.
\par Line or curve sources may be assigned either a total_source or a \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0 .  These are created with the open contour drawing tool located along the left side of the Argus ONE window.  A fluid line source may represent, for example, recharge occurring along a reach of a river or irrigation canal.  Depending on whether the user knows the total recharge along the canal reach, or the recharge per length of canal, the user should specify either total_source or \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0  in the \cf2\b\strike Sources of Fluid\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1700\}\cf0\b0  layer.  The contours representing these sources must be copied to the \cf2\b\strike Domain Outline\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1430\}\cf0\b0  layer to force nodes in the finite element mesh to be located along each source contour when the mesh is regenerated.  Alternatively, the command \b PIEs|Convert\'85|Mesh Objects to Contours\'85\b0  can be used to copy nodes and the edges of elements into \i Information \i0 layers.  FishNet meshes must be organized such that the nodes fall exactly at the source locations.
\par Area sources may be assigned either a \cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0  or a \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0 .  These are created with the closed contour drawing tool located along the left side of the Argus ONE window.  For fluid, an area source may represent, for example, ground-water recharge below a lake (\cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0  could be specified for the entire lake as one object) or rainfall recharge rate (volume per area) for a particular area (\cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0  could be specified in units [L/s] for the object).  For energy, an area source may represent, for example, heat production in a magma body (\cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0  could be specified for the entire body as one object) or radiogenic heat production rate (energy per area) for a particular area (\cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0  could be specified in units [E/sL^\super 2\nosupersub ] for the object).
\par Because contours may not cross one another in Argus ONE, only one type of object may be specified at any location.  Furthermore, SUTRA accepts only one source per location; thus two sources, for example, rainfall and a well, cannot be specified separately at the same location, and must be summed externally by the user before entering values into \b SutraGUI \b0 for 2D meshes.  
\par \pard\keep\fi720\sb120 To obtain areally distributed values affecting nodes throughout the 2D mesh, rather than exactly along contours in these layers, an expression should be used for the \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0  parameter.

\par \pard Sources of Fluid.QINUIN is calculated by Argus ONE. The UPPERCASE parameter name is intended to mark this parameter as being an internally-calculated value that should not be modified directly. This parameter is an intermediate value used by the \cf2\strike UIN\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1250\}\cf0  parameter of the SUTRA Mesh layer. The expression given for this parameter applies as the default value for the parameter in the entire layer. However, its actual purpose is only to correctly determine the net concentration (or temperature) of all source fluids assigned to nodes near closed contours (within one-half an element distance). Its value is the product of the fluid source and its concentration (or temperature). 
\par 
\par The value of the SUTRA Mesh layer parameter \cf2\strike UIN\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1250\}\cf0  (concentration or temperature of fluid source at a node) then is defined using the parameter in the following logic.
\par 
\par For a point or open contour object:
\par 
\par UIN = Sources of Fluid.concentration_of_source
\par 
\par Otherwise (i.e. for background and on or in closed contour objects):
\par 
\par UIN = NodeEffectiveValue(Sources of Fluid.QINUIN) / NodeEffectiveValue(Sources of Fluid.RESULTANT_FLUID_SOURCE)
\par 
\par The Argus ONE function, NodeEffectiveValue, gives an area-weighted average of its argument (see\f2  the\f1  \f3 Argus ONE User's Guide (\cf2\strike Argus Interware, 1997\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 )\f1 ). For each node within one-half element of closed contours, this second relation correctly determines the net concentration of all background and closed contour sources affecting the node, while the first simply assigns the point or line-source concentration to the nodes exactly below these source types.
\par 
\par In the case where the sources affecting a node are both inflows and outflows, there is an approximation the user must be aware of, as described in the following. Because SUTRA accepts only one source and source concentration (or temperature) per node, the various sources (and sinks) affecting each node are summed by the GUI giving a net source for each node. For a positive net source (i.e. an inflow) at a node, a net concentration of the fluid mixture must also be specified to SUTRA. When all the sources summed are inflows, calculation of a net concentration value of the net source is unambiguous because the concentrations of all inflowing fluids are given by the user as usual. When all of the sources affecting a node are outflows, no concentration needs to be specified to SUTRA at that node as this value will be a simulation result, as is usual with SUTRA. However, when some of the sources in the GUI affecting a node are inflows and some affecting the same node are outflows, and the resultant net source is an inflow, then the net concentration to be applied for this net inflow is ambiguous. This is because the concentration of the outflows to be summed with the inflows will generally be unknown to the user until after the simulation is complete. In this situation, the user should guess the concentration of outflowing fluid when specifying Sources of Fluid.concentration in order to approximate the net concentration. This need to guess outflow concentration prior to running a simulation will be a limitation until the SUTRA code is revised to accept multiple independent sources at each node. Note again that a guess is required only when both inflows and outflows occur in the neighborhood of a node, and the resulting source is an inflow.
\par 
\par To specify total_source or specific_source, the user must place a numeric value for one of these in the VALUE column of the Contour Information window that appears after completion of drawing an object. The value next to the other type of source parameter, which is not being used, must be set to $n/a, the Argus ONE symbol for a value that is "Not Assigned". The value of concentration (or temperature) must be set to a numeric value replacing the $n/a that appears for each new object. To switch between the two types of source specification, the user must place the $n/a in the type not being used. Using zero rather than $n/a will not work.
\par 
\par If the user desired to spread a single source evenly over the model domain, such as a recharge from rainfall, there would be two ways this could be accomplished. A closed contour could be drawn around the entire model domain, or the background value of Sources of Fluid.specific_source in the Layers dialog could be defined, setting it to a constant. Note that the interaction of background values and objects depends on the interpolation type (see "Interpretation of Contours and Point Data" (page 45)).
\par 
\par A visually appealing way to surround the model area with a closed contour would be to copy the contour representing the domain outline to this layer and assign it a source value.
\par 
\par Setting a value of 1 or "true" for Sources of Fluid.time_dependence will cause node numbers in the input file for SUTRA created by the Argus-SUTRA GUI to be negative. This, in turn, causes SUTRA to refer to the subroutine BCTIME at the beginning of each time step to obtain the time-dependent values for each node with a negative node number.
\par 
\par BCTIME must be user programmed to obtain the desired type of time variation as described in \cf2\strike Voss (1984)\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Voss84\}\cf0 . The FORTRAN source code for SUTRA and a FORTRAN compiler are required to use this feature.
\par 
\par A limitation of this version of the Argus-SUTRA GUI is that the separation of nodes into groups, where each group has a different time-dependence user-programmed in BCTIME, is not possible. The is because SUTRA does not currently accept such group input. Thus, negative node numbers will have to be manually discovered by the user for the purposes of programming BCTIME after mesh generation if there is to be more than one group of time-varying fluid source nodes. This may be done by using the Search For... command found under Edit along the top of the Argus ONE window, or by exporting the SUTRA dataset for the simulation and examining the file.

The value of \b concentration\b0  (or \b temperature\b0 ) must be set to a numeric value replacing the \b $n/a\b0  that appears for each new object; this is the concentration or temperature for any fluid that enters the model as a result of the pressure (or hydraulic head) being held constant.
\par 
\par When the Argus ONE interpretation scheme is set to its default for this layer, (\b Exact Contour method\b0 ), point, open and closed contour objects in this layer will only affect nodes in the \b SUTRA Mesh \b0 layer that occur exactly over (and within) these objects. This requires that the user copy open and point contours to the \b Domain Outline \b0 layer, and that the mesh be regenerated, to force the mesh to have nodes exactly along these contours. Some nodes naturally fall within the area delimited by closed contours, and these contours should not be copied to the \b Domain Outline \b0 layer (this would create holes in the mesh).
\par 
\par Setting a value of 1 or "true" for Specified Pressure.time_dependence (or \b Specified Hydraulic Head.time_dependence\b0 ) will cause node numbers in the input file for SUTRA created by the Argus-SUTRA GUI to be negative. This, in turn, causes SUTRA to refer to the subroutine BCTIME at the beginning of each time step to obtain the time-dependent values for each node with a negative node number. BCTIME must be user programmed to obtain the desired type of time variation as described in \cf2\strike Voss (1984)\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Voss84\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par A limitation of this version of the Argus-SUTRA GUI is that the separation of nodes into groups, where each group has a different time-dependence user-programmed in BCTIME, is not possible, because SUTRA does not presently accept such group input. Thus, negative node numbers will have to be manually discovered by the user for the purposes of programming BCTIME after mesh generation if there is to be more than one group of time-varying specified pressure (or hydraulic head) nodes.

\par \pard\fi720 
\par \pard\keep\fi720\sb120 The \b SUTRA Mesh (Top/Bottom Unit[i])\b0  layer is (are) the layer(s) on which the mesh used in the model is defined.  For 3D aligned meshes, there is only one such layer.  For 3D nonaligned meshes, there is one such layer at the top of the model and another at the bottom of each unit with the unit number after its name.  All 3D models must use a FishNet Mesh.  For 3D models, it must be possible to deform the FishNet Mesh into a grid bounded by a rectangle.  (This is not required for 2D models.)
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 In 3D models, the \b SUTRA Mesh\b0  layer (or layers) contains values of all the spatially distributed parameters except boundary conditions and observations.  Depending on SUTRA's requirements for each parameter, as specified in the documentation for the SUTRA input data sets (Voss and Provost, 2002), a parameter may receive a value for each node or for each element in the mesh.  These values are derived from the various Information layers described in following sections.  The Argus ONE environment refers to the assignment of values in one Information layer to another as "linking."  The names of the parameters of the SUTRA Mesh layer are listed in Table \lang1024 10\lang1033 .  The full Argus ONE name of each parameter is given as "Layer.Parameter," for example, the first parameter, \b NREG\b0 , in the table is \b SUTRA Mesh.NREG\b0 .
\par For 3D nonaligned models, the uppercase names of \b SUTRA Mesh\b0  parameters correspond exactly with variables used by the SUTRA model, and are described in the SUTRA documentation.  For 3D vertically aligned models, the uppercase names of SUTRA Mesh parameters correspond with variables used by the SUTRA model except that they have a number after them that determines to which model unit they belong.
\par There is one exception to the above.  The SUTRA parameter, \b UBC\b0 , representing the concentration or temperature of any fluid that may flow into the model at a node where pressure or hydraulic head is specified, has been changed to \b pUBC \b0 in \b SutraGUI \b0 to distinguish it from the specified concentration or temperature boundary condition type, which retains its original name (\b UBC\b0 ).
\par Two of the \b SUTRA Mesh\b0  parameters, \b QIN \b0 and \b QUIN\b0 , a fluid source and energy or solute source, respectively, have additional logic associated with their values.  As noted in the description of the \b Sources of Fluid \b0 and \b Sources of Energy \b0 or \b Sources of Solute \b0 layers, to which these node-wise parameters are linked, these sources may be specified at point, line (open) or closed contours.  Depending on which type of contour is specified in the "\b Sources\b0 " layer, the resultant source value provided as a parameter in the "\b Sources\b0 " layer may require multiplication by the open contour length or closed contour area or cell volume associated with the node; these multiplications are carried out automatically.
\par The \b Z[i] \b0 parameters on that layer represent the elevation of the i'th unit boundary.  Thus, the \b Z1 \b0 parameter represents the elevation of the top of the uppermost unit and \b Z2 \b0 represents the elevation of the bottom of the first unit.  \b Z[n+1] \b0 represents the elevation of the bottom of unit n.\f2

\par \pard\fi720\sb120 The \b FishNet_Mesh_Layout (Top/Bottom Unit[i]) \b0 layer is always included for 3D models.  \b SutraGUI\b0 , rather than Argus ONE, creates FishNet meshes.  A FishNet Mesh consists of superblocks (large contiguous quadrilaterals) each subdivided into a specified number of rows and columns of quadrilateral finite elements.  For 3D models, it must be possible to deform the mesh into a grid bounded by a rectangle.  
\par \pard\fi720 This layer, like the \cf2\b\strike SUTRA Mesh\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1990\}\cf0\b0  layer, is a Quad-Mesh layer.  However, the elements on it are usually drawn manually or are imported rather than being generated automatically.  Each element of the mesh will describe one "superblock" of the \cf2\b\strike SUTRA Mesh\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1990\}\cf0\b0 .  The "superblocks" describe the external and internal boundaries of the FishNet Mesh.  Each superblock element contains information describing the desired number of quadrilateral finite elements that will fill the superblock in the X and Y directions when the mesh is generated.  The use of the \b FishNet_Mesh_Layout\b0  layer is described in the section of this report entitled "\cf2\strike Creating FishNet Meshes\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2320\}\cf0 " on page \lang1024 68\lang1033 .

The concentration or temperature of the source must also be specified.  (However, for fluxes out of the model, SUTRA will automatically use the concentration or temperature at the node rather than the specified value.)  The user must specify whether a boundary is a time-dependent source.  (Time-dependent sources must be programmed into SUTRA in the subroutine BCTIME as described in the SUTRA manual.  Because there is no standard method for specifying time-dependent input for SUTRA, \b SutraGUI \b0 does not generate input files for the time-dependent data.)  If desired, the user can specify a comment for a contour.  Such comments will be included in the SUTRA input file created by \b SutraGUI\b0 .  They can be used to help identify the nodes associated with particular contours, (for example, when programming subroutine BCTIME to vary sources at certain nodes or groups of nodes representing a hydrologic feature with time).

\par \pard\fi720 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 Two types of layers that represent hydrologic sources: \b Sources of Fluid Top\b0  and \b Sources of Solute Top  / Sources of Energy Top\b0 .  These \i Information \i0 layers contain information on fluxes (quantity per time) of fluid, solute, and energy entering or leaving a unit.  The section of the report entitled "\cf2\strike Hydrologic Sources: 3D Objects\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2030\}\cf0 " on page \lang1024 57\lang1033  describes how to specify sources within units.)
\par In these layers, \b SutraGUI \b0 allows specification of fluid sources or sinks and energy/solute sources or sinks at points, along line segments, and for delimited areas.  Sources have positive values, whereas sinks are specified with a negative number.  Sources of fluid may be either specified as a total amount of fluid per second (that is, \cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0 ), or as the total amount of fluid per second per length or area of the source object (that is, \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0 ).  Similarly, sources of energy/solute may be either specified as a total amount of energy/solute per second (that is, \cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1780\}\cf0\b0 ), or as the total amount of energy/solute per second per length or per area of the source object (that is, \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\b0\strike0\{linkID=1790\}\cf0 ).  For 3D models where elevations of the top may vary, the areas used are the projection of these surfaces in the X-Y plane.
\par Point sources may be assigned only a \cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0 .  Point sources typically represent injection or withdrawal wells for fluid sources.  The command \b PIEs|Convert\'85|Mesh Objects to Contours\'85\b0  in the Utility PIE (\cf2\strike Winston, 2001\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Winston01\}\cf0 ) can be used to copy nodes into information layers as point contours.  The mesh must be organized such that the nodes fall exactly at the source locations.
\par Line or curve sources may be assigned either a \cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0  or a \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0 .  A fluid line source may represent, for example, recharge occurring along a reach of a river or irrigation canal.  Depending on whether the user knows the total recharge along the canal reach, or the recharge per length of canal, the user should specify either \cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0  or \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0  in the \b Sources of Fluid\b0  layer.  The command \b PIEs|Convert\'85|Mesh Objects to Contours\'85\b0  can be used to copy nodes and the edges of elements into information layers.  The mesh must be organized such that the nodes fall exactly at the source locations.
\par Area sources may be assigned either a \cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0  or a \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0 .  These are created with the closed contour drawing tool located along the left side of the Argus ONE window.  For fluid, an area source may represent, for example, ground-water recharge below a lake (\cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0  could be specified for the entire lake as one object) or rainfall recharge rate (volume per area) for a particular area (\cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0  could be specified in units [L/s] for the object).  For energy, an area source may represent, for example, heat production in a magma body (\cf2\b\strike total_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1710\}\cf0\b0  could be specified for the entire body as one object) or radiogenic heat production rate (energy per area) for a particular area (\cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0  could be specified in units [E/sL^\super 2\nosupersub ] for the object).
\par Because contours may not cross one another in Argus ONE, only one type of object may be specified at any location.  Furthermore, SUTRA accepts only one source per location; thus two sources, for example, rainfall and a well, cannot be specified separately at the same location, and must be summed externally by the user before entering values into \b SutraGUI \b0 for sources specified on the top of a 3D model mesh.  (For 3D models, multiple sources can be specified at one location using 3D source objects.  \b SutraGUI \b0 will combine these into a single source before exporting the data to SUTRA.)
\par To obtain areally distributed values affecting nodes throughout the mesh, rather than exactly along contours in the top, an expression should be used for the \cf2\b\strike specific_source\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1720\}\cf0\b0  parameter.  The reader is referred to the section of this report entitled "\cf2\strike Adding a Precipitation Data Layer and Linking It to Fluid Sources Layer\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2390\}\cf0 ."

\par \pard\fi720 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 The \b Unsaturated Properties Unit[i]\b0  layer is used to specify regions that have different unsaturated flow properties.  
\par \pard\li720\sb120\i Note: Unsaturated-flow simulation with SUTRA requires some user programming in the SUTRA subroutine UNSAT for the user to specify the unsaturated functions for each region as described in Voss and Provost (2002).  The FORTRAN source code for SUTRA and a FORTRAN compiler are required to use this feature.  Because there is not a standard format for any additional information that must be read into the program for unsaturated properties, \b SutraGUI \b0 does not create input files for unsaturated flow properties.  However, users may be able to create an export template for use within Argus ONE that will generate such files for their particular case, as described on p. 169-188 of the Argus ONE User's Guide (\cf2\strike Argus Interware Inc., 1997\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 ).
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\i0 The \b Unsaturated Properties Unit[i]\b0  layer contains information on the spatial distribution of regions having constant unsaturated properties in the unit to be modeled, or for generic studies, in the medium to be modeled.  This layer only appears when a \cf2\strike saturated-unsaturated\cf3\strike0\{linkID=180\}\cf0  problem type has been selected in the \b SUTRA Project Information\b0  dialog box.  The layer contains only one parameter, \b region \b0 (an integer), which contains the identification number of the region.  Usually the \i Exact Contour\i0  method should be used to define the location of regions in this layer, in which case only closed contours should be used for specifying regions.  The \i Exact Contour \i0 method is already specified as the default selection for this layer.  After closing a contour, the user must assign its region number in the \i Contour Information \i0 dialog box.  Any number of contours may share the same region number.  Each region represents one type of material having uniform unsaturated property functions.  For example, region 1 may be fine silt, region 2 may be clay, and region 3 may be coarse sand.  Each type of material may occur in a number of places within the model domain.  The default region number is zero.  To create regions that share a boundary (such as geologic layers), turn on the option \i Special|Allow Intersection \i0 before drawing contours.  If the user wishes to have nodes and element edges occur exactly at region boundaries, then for a FishNet Mesh, these boundaries need to be defined as the edges of superblocks in a \cf2\strike FishNet Mesh layout\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2000\}\cf0 .  \f2

\par \pard\fi720 
\par A FishNet Mesh (\cf2\strike for example, fig. 3 on page \lang1024 9\cf3\strike0\{linkID=25\}\cf0\lang1033 ) consists of superblocks (large contiguous quadrilaterals) that are each subdivided into a specified number of quadrilateral finite elements, four of which are connected to each internal node.  The mesh may be considered similar to a deformed finite-difference grid.  FishNet meshes are created as follows.
\par \pard\fi720\sb240\sa60\b\fs28 Prepare to Draw the Layout of the FishNet Mesh\b0\fs24

Enter the desired number of elements in the X and Y directions (for example, 10 and 15) next to the names \cf2\b\strike elements_in_x\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1410\}\cf0\b0  and \cf2\b\strike elements_in_y\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1420\}\cf0\b0  below the word "Value".  These values determine how many rows and columns of quadrilateral finite elements this superblock will be divided into when the mesh is generated.  To exit the dialog box, click OK to accept the values or Cancel to leave the values unaltered.
\par \pard\li720\sb120\i Note: To determine the X and Y directions for the element, identify the two nodes with the largest X-coordinates.  Of those two, the one with the largest Y coordinate is treated as being in the upper right corner of the element.  If the nodes have the same Y-coordinate, the one with the larger X coordinate is treated as being in the upper right corner of the element.  If the nodes with the second and third highest X-coordinates have the same X-coordinate, then the one with the higher Y-coordinate is selected as one of the two with the highest X-coordinate.
\par Note: Superblocks may contain redundant information concerning number of rows and columns of elements.  For example, each superblock in a pair of superblocks side-by-side in the X direction will have a value for \cf2\b\strike elements_in_y\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1420\}\cf0\b0 .  Because the FishNet Mesh design requires there to be the same number of rows of elements across both blocks, the user should provide each superblock with the same value for \cf2\b\strike elements_in_y\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1420\}\cf0\b0 .  \b SutraGUI \b0 is designed so that if these numbers do not agree, then the higher value is applied throughout that row or column of superblocks.\i0

\par \pard\fi-360\li1080\sb60\tx1100 7.\tab Usually, the user will want to join at least one side of each new superblock to a previously drawn one.  To draw the next superblock, select the element tool again and move the cursor over one of the nodes of the previous superblock along the side to which the new one will be joined.  The cursor will change to a large hollow plus sign when it is over one of the nodes of the other element.  Click with the mouse at this point to begin drawing a new element that includes the node under the mouse.
\par 8.\tab If another node of a previous superblock is to be shared with the new superblock, then move the cursor over the next previously existing node and click again when the cursor becomes a hollow plus sign.

\par \pard\li720\sb120\i Note: The \cf2\b\strike SUTRA Mesh\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1060\}\cf0\b0  layer must be empty (that is, contain no old mesh) for this choice to be available.  Old meshes must be deleted first by clicking Edit|Select All, and then pressing the delete key.

The resulting mesh that appears in the \cf2\b\strike SUTRA Mesh\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1060\}\cf0\b0  layer is shown in figure 18.  Almost any arrangement of superblocks is possible.  
\par \pard\li720\sb120\i Note: although the mesh in figure 18 is suitable for a 2D model, it is not suitable for a 3D model.

\par \pard\fi720 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 Once a SUTRA model has been prepared, the next steps are to export the SUTRA input files and run SUTRA.  To export the input files for SUTRA, make \cf2\b\strike SUTRA Mesh\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1060\}\cf0\b0  (or \cf2\b\strike Sutra Mesh Top\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1990\}\cf0\b0  or \cf2\b\strike SUTRA Mesh Bottom Unit[i])\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1990\}\cf0\b0  the active layer.  Then select \b PIEs|Run Sutra\'85\b0  from the menu.  The \b Run SUTRA\b0  dialog box will appear (fig. 19).

\par \pard\fi720\sb120\sa120\b Figure \lang1024 19\lang1033 .  The Run SUTRA dialog box.
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\b0 The \b Run SUTRA\b0  dialog box provides several options that the user can select.  First, there is the "root file name for simulation."  This is the part of the file name before the extension that will be used to create all of the file names for the input and output files for SUTRA.  For example if the root file name is "A_Name," the main SUTRA input file would be "A_Name.inp" and the name of the node output file would be "A_Name.nod."  
\par Next is a pair of radio buttons.  Depending on which one is selected, \b SutraGUI \b0 will either only create the SUTRA input files or will create the SUTRA input files and then run SUTRA.  
\par \pard\keep\fi720\sb120 Next there are three radio buttons that can be used to control how much error checking will be done during the export of the SUTRA input files.  The first choice (Show all warnings) is selected by default.  The user also can choose either to show only warnings that would cause an invalid SUTRA input file to be created or to show no warnings.  
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 Next, there is a check box that, if checked, indicates that an external calibration program such as UCODE (Poeter and Hill, 1998) or PEST (Doherty, 1994) is running Argus ONE.  If the calibrate checkbox is checked, several changes will be made to the batch file that SutraGUI creates to run SUTRA.  First, a "wait" option will be included after SUTRA.  This will cause the operating system to wait until after SUTRA has finished running before processing the next line of the batch file.  Second, a new line will be added to the batch file after the one that starts SUTRA.  This will call the program "WaitForMe" described in Winston (1999).  The external program that is running Argus ONE should also call WaitForMe just after sending the commands to Argus ONE to start creating the SUTRA input file.  When WaitForMe is run a second time, the first and second copies of WaitForMe will close, which will signal the calibration program that it can now read the results from SUTRA.  The third change made to the batch file if the "Calibrate" checkbox is checked is that the "pause" command will not be included at the end of the batch file.
\par Below the calibrate check box, there is the \b SUTRA Path\b0  edit box in which the user specifies the full path of the SUTRA program.  A "Browse" button next to the edit box can be used to select the full path of the SUTRA program interactively.
\par Below the \b SUTRA Path\b0  edit box, there is a checkbox labeled \b Save temporary files for reuse by SutraGUI\b0 .  If this checkbox is checked, certain temporary files created by \b SutraGUI \b0 will be saved for reuse the next time the SUTRA input files are created.  The temporary files that are saved contain the input data for certain data sets in SUTRA.  If those data sets have not changed since the last time the SUTRA input files were generated, the user can save time by not exporting those data sets again.  However, the data sets must still be present in the SUTRA input file.  To solve this problem, \b SutraGUI \b0 creates a separate temporary file (saved in the working directory for the project) for each data set and then combines them in the final SUTRA input file.  If the checkbox to save the temporary files is checked, the temporary files are not deleted after the final input file is generated and can be reused the next time the SUTRA input files are generated.  If the \b Save temporary files\b0  checkbox is not checked, and only some data sets should be exported, \b SutraGUI \b0 will disassemble the prior versions of the input files (that must be located in the working directory for the project) to create a temporary file for each data set.  Those files that are not replaced during the export process will then be incorporated into the new input file.
\par After the \b Save temporary files\b0  checkbox, there is a group of checkboxes with the names of data sets in the SUTRA input file.  In order to save some execution time for \b SutraGUI \b0 export, if some of the data sets can remain the same as they were when they were last exported, the user can uncheck the corresponding checkbox and the data sets will not be exported again.  Only those data sets that can require a substantial amount of time to export have corresponding checkboxes.  The other data sets are always exported.  The \b None \b0 and \b All \b0 buttons beneath the checkboxes will cause none or all of the checkboxes to become checked, respectively.
\par Finally, on the separate \b Memory options\b0  tab, there is a set of options that affect memory usage during export of the SUTRA input files in 3D models.  During the export process, \b SutraGUI \b0 must determine the polyhedron around each node that represents the cell of that node.  This can be a computationally intensive and time-consuming process.  However, in large models, the amount of memory required to store the polyhedrons can be prohibitive.  The \b SutraGUI \b0 has several options for dealing with this situation.  In almost all cases, the best choice is the default choice, which is to recalculate the polyhedrons each time they are needed.  For some small models, a better choice may be to calculate the polyhedrons once and them keep them in memory.  However, for larger models, the computer may start to use virtual memory, which tends to be slow.  When the computer is using virtual memory, some items that would normally be in physical memory are stored on the hard drive and then read back into physical memory when needed.  Another option provided by the \b SutraGUI \b0 is to save the polyhedrons to a file on the disk.  This allows the polyhedrons to be read from the disk file during a future run.  However, it is usually faster to compute the polyhedrons than to read them from disk so this option will not be advantageous in most circumstances.

\par The Argus ONE User's Guide (\cf4\strike Argus Interware, 1997\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 ) provides details of adding \i Information \i0 layers and linking \i Information \i0 layers to each other using mathematical expressions.
\par In the second example, thickness may be calculated from "Top" and "Bottom" information contained in a single layer.  In this case, it would be necessary to add two parameters to the \b Thickness \b0 layer as follows.\f3 
\par \pard\fi-360\li1080\sb60\tx1100\f2 1.\tab Bring up the \i Layers' Floater\i0  by clicking on the \i Layers...\i0  button along the top of the Argus ONE window.
\par 2.\tab Click on the button \i Layers \i0 at the top of the \i Layers' Floater\i0 .
\par 3.\tab In the \i Layers \i0 dialog box, use the down arrow to position the highlighted layer to be \b Thickness\b0 , and click on button \i New \i0 below the label Parameter twice (not below the label \i Layer\i0 , which would add a new layer).  Each click creates a new parameter.
\par 4.\tab Set the first parameter name by typing "Top" to replace the default parameter name after clicking on "New Parameter."  This parameter will be used to set the elevation of the top of the aquifer.
\par 5.\tab Set the second parameter name by typing "Bottom" to replace the second default parameter name after clicking on "New Parameter 1."  This parameter will be used to set the elevation of the bottom of the aquifer.
\par 6.\tab In the parameter listing area, click on the line containing parameter \i thickness \i0 in the list found on the lower part of the dialog box.  Then click on the \i fx \i0 button.
\par 7.\tab In the \i Expression Editor\i0 , scroll the left scroll bar until an entry for layer "Thickness" is visible and click on it.  Click on entry "Top."  That entry will then appear in the box to the right.
\par 8.\tab A list of parameters of this layer appears in the right-hand box.  In this case, there are three parameters.  Double-click on the "Top" entry in the right-hand box, and the parameter "Top" will appear in the expression box at the top of the \i Expression Editor\i0 .
\par 9.\tab Insert a minus sign after "Top."
\par 10.\tab Repeat step 8 to add parameter "Bottom" to the expression.  The expression "Top - Bottom" should now be in the upper box.
\par 11.\tab Click \i OK\i0 .
\par 12.\tab In the \i Layers \i0 dialog box, click \i Done\i0 .\f3 
\par \pard\li720\sb60\tx720 
\par \pard\fi720\sb120\f2 From now on, elevations of objects in parameter "Bottom" will be subtracted from elevations in parameter "Top" to calculate values for parameter "Thickness."  This method somewhat restricts the flexibility of the distributions possible for "Top" and "Bottom" as they are defined as parameters of the same graphic objects.  For the previous example, where new layers were defined, the contours of "Top" and "Bottom" could, in effect, cross one another.

\par \pard\fi720\sb120 The \b CheckMatchBC \b0 program is used to compare the values of specified pressure and concentration boundaries as specified in the SUTRA input file as compared to the actual values calculated for such boundaries by SUTRA.  Ideal selection of the GNUP and GNUU in Dataset 5 cause the simulated and specified values to match from six to eight decimal places.  If the simulated and specified values match more closely than that, the flux at the boundary node may not be calculated with sufficient precision.
\par To run the program, double-click on it in Windows Explorer, click on the \b Select Files\b0  button and select the input (*.inp) and node (*.nod) file for a SUTRA model.  The program will display the maximum and minimum relative differences for pressure and concentration along with the node numbers at which these occur, the specified value, the calculated value, and the number of digits that match.  The relative difference is calculated as follows:

\par \pard\fi720 
\par \b SutraGUI \b0 is a graphical user-interface for SUTRA.  It supports two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) simulations.  \b SutraGUI \b0 is based on a commercial package, Argus ONE\'99 (\cf2\strike Argus Interware, Inc., 1997\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ArgusInterware\}\cf0 ), which provides 2D Geographic Information System and meshing support.  For 2D models, the new version of \b SutraGUI \b0 described in this report is much the same as the previous version (\cf2\strike Voss and others, 1997\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Voss97\}\cf0 ).  For 3D models, the model domain is divided into a stack of tabular units and these units are used to assign aquifer properties, boundary conditions, and initial conditions to different, vertically separate parts of the model.  In addition, 3D objects are used to assign boundary conditions.  Three-dimensional objects are defined by associating elevations with 2D objects built into Argus ONE.  Another feature of this version of \b SutraGUI \b0 is a comprehensive Help system.

\par \pard\fi720 Assume that there are four lakes, one at each corner of a closed alluvial valley.

\par 
\par \pard\fi720\cf0\f2 This step-by-step example reproduces a classic simulation example for testing variable-density transport codes that is presented as an example simulation in the SUTRA documentation (\cf3\strike Voss, 1984\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=Voss84\}\cf0 , section 6.5, page 196).  It involves creating a rectangular cross-sectional model domain containing a FishNet Mesh, and applying boundary conditions exactly along the two vertical edges of the domain.  Along one edge, a total fluid inflow is specified and \b SutraGUI \b0 is allowed to distribute the value of fluid sources along the edge.  Along the other edge, the user creates a specified pressure condition in a single object that linearly increases with depth representing hydrostatic seawater.  The user should read the above-mentioned section of the SUTRA documentation for background on this problem before beginning.

Set the Expression for the \b minimum \b0 parameter to \b maximum \b0 in the same way and then click the \i Done \i0 button.
\par \pard\fi720\sb120 This expression has several parts.  First, there is the \i If \i0 function: \i If(Condition, True_Value, False_Value).  \i0 The \i If \i0 function can be found below Mathematical in the expression editor.  For this example, if \i (ContourArea()>0)&(Sutra_Z()>3)\i0  evaluates to True, the hydraulic conductivity will be set to 1e-7 (the \i True_Value\i0 ).  Otherwise, it will be set to 1e-3 (the \i False _Value\i0 ).  The Condition, in this case, has two parts:\i  (ContourArea()>0)\i0  and \i (Sutra_Z()>3)\i0 .  Both must evaluate to True for the entire condition to evaluate to True.  When using the \i Exact \i0 interpretation method, \i ContourArea() \i0 is greater than 0 only inside closed contours.  (Using the \i Nearest \i0 method, it would be 'true' everywhere in a layer on which there was at least one closed contour, so the \i Exact \i0 method must be used.)  In the \i Expression Editor\i0 , the \i ContourArea() \i0 function can be found under \i Contour\i0 .  \cf3\b\strike Sutra_Z()\cf4\strike0\{linkID=40\}\cf0\b0  is the elevation of a node or element in the 3D mesh.  In the \i Expression Editor\i0 , the \cf3\b\strike Sutra_Z()\cf4\strike0\{linkID=40\}\cf0\b0  function can be found under \i PIEs\i0 .  Thus, this condition will only be 'true' inside closed contours on the \b Hydraulic Conductivity Unit1 \b0 layer for elements whose centers have an elevation higher than 3.  The top elevation of the model was set to 10 and the bottom elevation is, by default, 0.  The vertical discretization was set to 10 elements.  Thus, if a closed contour is drawn on the \b Hydraulic Conductivity Unit1 \b0 layer and it uses the default values for the \b maximum\b0 , \b middle\b0 , and \b minimum \b0 parameters, a low hydraulic conductivity zone that reaches down to an elevation of 3 will be defined.\f3
